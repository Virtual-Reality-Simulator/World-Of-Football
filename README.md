# World of Football

This is a developer backup copy of _World of Football_. A game that was never released. It was designed by Dennis Hansen and developed Jad Nohra between the years 2006 and 2008. The game was not a commercial project.

Below is a bit of information to help navigating the backup.

The game engine was built from scratch with almost no usage of third party code or libraries, it was called _Witch Engine_ found in _WitchEngine3/src/WE3_. On top, an editor was built called _Evil Eye_ found in _WitchEngine3/src/EE_. Based on both, the game itself _World of Football_. Aside from the source code folder _WOF2/src_, of interest are the assets found in _WOF2/deploy/assets_, including the AI scripts found in _WOF2/deploy/assets/script_.

The idea of the game was to bring back the gameplay of old soccer game classics, based on skill using the controller, and away from canned special moves, but using relatively modern (at the time) 3D graphics. Videos and screenshots of features, developments, and silly stuff, are in the folder _Media_.
